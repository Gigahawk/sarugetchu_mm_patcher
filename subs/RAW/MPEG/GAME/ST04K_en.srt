1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,039
You made it this far too? Quite impressive.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,549
Quit it already, Specter! You're causing trouble for everyone!

3
00:00:10,154 --> 00:00:11,041
Jeez...

4
00:00:11,751 --> 00:00:16,553
Have you not figured out what's going on yet?

5
00:00:17,323 --> 00:00:20,057
You're all so slow...

6
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:25,068
Haven't you noticed the monkeys are acting a little differently this time?

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,201
Huh? What do you mean?

8
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:30,571
Now that you mention it, it does feel different from before...

9
00:00:31,338 --> 00:00:33,567
True, until now everything's seemed

10
00:00:33,577 --> 00:00:36,113
like the usual monkey behavior.

11
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,238


12
00:00:38,264 --> 00:00:39,781
What are you talking about!

13
00:00:39,816 --> 00:00:41,601
I always have a sense of humor!

14
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,683
Right, I never forget about humor, even in battle.

15
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:51,763
A good sense of humor is essential for world domination.

16
00:00:51,792 --> 00:00:55,632
Wow, that's deep, I'm kind of impressed.

17
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,827
Eh? What does he mean?

18
00:00:58,037 --> 00:01:00,230
Jeez, what are you talking about?

19
00:01:01,038 --> 00:01:03,774
That's right, enough of this nonsense!

20
00:01:04,802 --> 00:01:07,798
You guys came to defeat me, right?

21
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,083
Then lets get started.

22
00:01:11,115 --> 00:01:13,070
The guy I crushed before

23
00:01:13,102 --> 00:01:15,420
you got here was too weak.

24
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:19,099
It wasn't even a warm up,

25
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,786
but I think you guys can entertain me a little, right?

26
00:01:22,823 --> 00:01:23,883
What!?

27
00:01:24,425 --> 00:01:28,118
Don’t tell me… You’re not talking about Haruka-chan, right?

28
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:31,060


29
00:01:31,085 --> 00:01:32,125
Let's go!
