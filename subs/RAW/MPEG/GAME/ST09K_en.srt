1
00:00:04,985 --> 00:00:07,720
な、なんだか!脱出したのか!

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,039
おのれ!

3
00:00:10,551 --> 00:00:13,540
くっ、この役立たずめ!

4
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:26,570


5
00:00:38,784 --> 00:00:42,108
1艦、この戦艦から脱出するんじゃ

6
00:00:44,618 --> 00:00:46,560


7
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,951
クソ、せっかくの計画が台無しだ

8
00:00:52,894 --> 00:00:54,625
この船は爆破する

9
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:57,095
少々時間稼ぎが必要だ

10
00:00:57,565 --> 00:00:59,123
これをばらまいてやる

11
00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:02,065
どうした

12
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:05,866
貴様

13
00:01:06,965 --> 00:01:07,576
何をする

14
00:01:12,115 --> 00:01:15,106


15
00:01:26,526 --> 00:01:28,585


16
00:01:36,142 --> 00:02:59,513


17
00:02:16,244 --> 00:02:17,494
Good evening

18
00:02:17,503 --> 00:02:19,773
This is NSB Emergency News

19
00:02:20,513 --> 00:02:21,384
Breaking news

20
00:02:21,853 --> 00:02:23,281
We have been able to obtain

21
00:02:23,305 --> 00:02:24,744
the following document

22
00:02:25,758 --> 00:02:26,780
Under The Monkey

23
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,148
With The Monkey

24
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,191
Flyers like these

25
00:02:30,215 --> 00:02:32,919
are being distributed all over the world

26
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:36,524
The Anti-Monkeys World Defense

27
00:02:36,548 --> 00:02:38,448
has released the following comment

28
00:02:38,472 --> 00:02:40,461
to the entire human race

29
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,209
Citizens!

30
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:46,166
Please do not get deceived by these monkeys

31
00:02:46,573 --> 00:02:49,102
The monkeys plan to destroy the Earth,

32
00:02:49,784 --> 00:02:51,071
enslave the human race,

33
00:02:51,573 --> 00:02:52,506
and conquer us!

34
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:55,175
Do not get deceived!

35
00:02:56,949 --> 00:03:00,131
Local residents are forming their own civilian forces

36
00:03:00,155 --> 00:03:02,715
aside from the Anti-Monkeys World Defense

37
00:03:03,457 --> 00:03:05,456
Here is a report on one of the groups

38
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:17,685
These villagers are training to capture monkeys using homemade nets

39
00:03:19,344 --> 00:03:27,858
idk german

40
00:03:29,527 --> 00:03:32,918
Meanwhile, these men are making a monkey trap

41
00:03:33,571 --> 00:03:45,092
idk dutch

42
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,324
We wish the best for them

43
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,947
Next, on the news

44
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:54,134
One of the huge battleships in Japan has crashed into the sea

45
00:03:54,746 --> 00:03:56,454
Details are not yet known

46
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:59,940
At the scene, we have Ms. Sato Nonaka

47
00:04:18,075 --> 00:04:21,552
This footage of the battleship was taken by an eye witness

48
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:24,840
As the ship explodes and crashes into the sea,

49
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:28,687
a green, mist-like smoke can be seen coming from it

50
00:04:31,024 --> 00:04:36,432
Since the battleship fell, there has been a completely new lifeform vandalizing the cities

51
00:04:37,156 --> 00:04:39,834
These creatures have never been seen on the Earth before,

52
00:04:39,986 --> 00:04:43,349
and very little is known about these creatures at present

53
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:46,672
We warn you not to go out,

54
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:49,923
and to exercise extreme caution

55
00:04:51,553 --> 00:04:53,137
I am Fraya DeVapes,

56
00:04:53,254 --> 00:04:55,428
that was the latest news
