1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,039
You made it this far too? Quite impressive

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,549
Quit it already, Specter! Aren't we all in trouble?

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:16,563
Jeez, have you not figured out what's going on yet?

4
00:00:17,323 --> 00:00:19,060
You're all so slow...

5
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:25,068
Haven't you noticed the monkeys are acting a little differently this time?

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,201
Huh? What do you mean?

7
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:30,571
Now that you mention it, it does feel different from before...

8
00:00:31,338 --> 00:00:36,110
True, until now everything's seemed like the usual monkey behavior.

9
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,238


10
00:00:38,264 --> 00:00:39,781
What are you talking about!

11
00:00:39,816 --> 00:00:41,601
I always have a sense of humor!

12
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,683
Right, I never forget about humor, even in battle.

13
00:00:47,391 --> 00:00:51,763
A good sense of humor is essential for world domination.

14
00:00:51,792 --> 00:00:55,632
Wow, that's deep, I'm kind of impressed.

15
00:00:55,793 --> 00:00:57,827
Eh? What does he mean?

16
00:00:58,037 --> 00:01:00,230
Jeez, what are you talking about?

17
00:01:01,038 --> 00:01:03,774
That's right, enough of this nonsense!

18
00:01:04,802 --> 00:01:07,798
You guys came to defeat me, right?

19
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,083
Then lets get started.

20
00:01:10,324 --> 00:01:15,586
The guy I crushed before

21
00:01:13,102 --> 00:01:15,420
you got here was too weak.

22
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:19,099
It wasn't even a warm up,

23
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,786
but I think you guys can entertain me a little, right?

24
00:01:22,823 --> 00:01:23,883
What!?

25
00:01:24,425 --> 00:01:28,118
Don’t tell me… You’re not talking about Haruka-chan, right?

26
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:31,060


27
00:01:31,085 --> 00:01:32,125
Let's go!
