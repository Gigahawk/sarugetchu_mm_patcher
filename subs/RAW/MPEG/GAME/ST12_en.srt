00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:11,064
Good morning

2
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:13,867
This is NSB Emergency News

3
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,054
First in the news

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,301
People who have decided to join forces

5
00:00:19,325 --> 00:00:22,089
with the monkeys have been sighted in the cities

6
00:00:22,786 --> 00:00:25,279
They have pleged their allegiance to the monkeys,

7
00:00:25,548 --> 00:00:28,238
and there has been a festive mood all over the world

8
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:30,351
as these people increase in numbers

9
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,726
Government of the monkeys,

10
00:00:33,946 --> 00:00:34,956
by the monkeys,

11
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:36,211
and for the monkeys!

12
00:00:36,387 --> 00:00:37,876
Hurah for the monkeys!

13
00:00:37,984 --> 00:00:39,595
Hurah for the monkeys!

14
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:40,840
Hurah for the monkeys!

15
00:00:41,806 --> 00:00:44,985
It appears that the situation is quite chaotic

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,744
Next, from Japan

17
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,841
The mysterious creatures that have been vandalizing the cities,

18
00:00:52,242 --> 00:00:55,851
are thought to be from the huge crashed battleship in the ocean

19
00:00:56,782 --> 00:00:59,000
We have a helicopter report from the site

20
00:01:00,445 --> 00:01:01,451
Nonaka-san?

21
00:01:02,403 --> 00:01:03,414
Nonaka-san?

22
00:01:05,572 --> 00:01:08,572
Yes, we're currently flying over the battleship crash site

23
00:01:08,582 --> 00:01:11,585
It's about 5km from the coast

24
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:14,201
The battleship didn't sink,

25
00:01:14,225 --> 00:01:16,079
it's currently floating on the ocean surface

26
00:01:16,089 --> 00:01:18,579
You can see broken parts scattered around

27
00:01:19,061 --> 00:01:23,981
It looks like a green gas or liquid is leaking from it

28
00:01:23,991 --> 00:01:26,083
That green substance might be

29
00:01:26,093 --> 00:01:29,086
the cause of the mysterious creature outbreak

30
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:32,756
It's too dangerous to get any closer,

31
00:01:32,767 --> 00:01:35,936
but it looks like a giant creature is moving around inside

32
00:01:41,238 --> 00:01:44,091
Well it seems we're having some technical difficulties

33
00:01:44,531 --> 00:01:47,118
We will get back to you later with more news

34
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:50,019
I am Fraya DeVapes,

35
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:52,504
that was the latest news
