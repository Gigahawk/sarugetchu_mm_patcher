1
00:00:01,015 --> 00:00:02,035
Can you hear me?

2
00:00:02,514 --> 00:00:03,477
It's Haruka!

3
00:00:05,251 --> 00:00:08,946
The monkey's trailer is heading your way,

4
00:00:09,757 --> 00:00:11,908
but it's being attacked...

5
00:00:12,858 --> 00:00:15,525
Please, protect that trailer!

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,057
Huh? I don't really get what's going on,

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,152
but it sounds like an emergency!

8
00:00:22,633 --> 00:00:25,889
Um, who's on that trailer?

9
00:00:26,077 --> 00:00:30,363
Um... I think youâ€™ve met them before...

10
00:00:31,535 --> 00:00:32,881
They're the Pipotrons

11
00:00:32,974 --> 00:00:34,082
What!?

12
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:43,621
Why are the Pipotrons driving the monkeys' trailer?

13
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:47,378
Why does Haruka want to help the Pipotrons...?

14
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,575
Jeez!

15
00:00:48,585 --> 00:00:51,121
You're so annoying with all your questions!

16
00:00:51,465 --> 00:00:53,377
You're always like this!

17
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:57,280
I'm sure you have a reason right Haruka?

18
00:00:54,414 --> 00:00:57,224
(Kakeru) Huh!? Don't treat me like a kid!

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,633
(Natsumi) You are a child!

20
00:00:57,798 --> 00:00:59,793
I trust you

21
00:00:57,806 --> 00:00:59,978
(Kakeru) I'm asking because I don't understand!

22
00:00:58,617 --> 00:00:59,929
(Natsumi) Just like a child!

23
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:05,405
After all, I don't think the Pipotrons are a bad bunch

24
00:01:00,538 --> 00:01:03,230
(Kakeru) I wouldn't be asking if I understood!

25
00:01:02,268 --> 00:01:03,862
(Natsumi) Ahh, you're really annoying!

26
00:01:04,626 --> 00:01:05,365
(Kakeru) Stop yelling!

27
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,633
(Natsumi) Stop yelling!

28
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,201
(Kakeru) What!? I'm not yelling!

29
00:01:05,606 --> 00:01:07,345
(Natsumi) What!? I'm not yelling!

30
00:01:06,405 --> 00:01:07,414
Everyone! Listen to me!

31
00:01:09,584 --> 00:01:11,969
No matter how many Blobs you defeat,

32
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:14,678
they'll just keep regenerating!

33
00:01:15,249 --> 00:01:16,712
In order to defeat the Blobs,

34
00:01:16,722 --> 00:01:20,113
you'll need to use a special weapon developed by that man

35
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,612
The trailer being driven by the Pipotrons

36
00:01:22,623 --> 00:01:24,025
is carrying those weapons

37
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:28,198
I beg you! Please protect the Pipotrons!
