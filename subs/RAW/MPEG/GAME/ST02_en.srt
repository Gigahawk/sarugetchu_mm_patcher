1
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,778
This is NSB Emergency News.

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,016
The monkey's base the near industrial complex

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,918
that we reported on previously

4
00:00:17,942 --> 00:00:20,955
has been destroyed by an unknown force.

5
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:24,591
Since it has been difficult to get close to this base

6
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:26,460
due to the monkey's tight security

7
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:29,329
we have as yet to discover how

8
00:00:29,353 --> 00:00:32,299
and by whom the base has been destroyed.

9
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:37,571
The Anti-Monkeys World Defence has not a reached a conclusion

10
00:00:37,595 --> 00:00:39,406
either as to what has happened there,

11
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,109
and is currently investigating the situation.

12
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:55,644
In other news, the monkeys are continuing to build

13
00:00:55,668 --> 00:00:57,725
banana fields for their food supply.

14
00:00:58,103 --> 00:01:02,028
As you can see, more and more areas are being transformed

15
00:01:02,052 --> 00:01:03,405
into banana fields.

16
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:07,670
In this way, the monkeys are preparing for a future increase

17
00:01:07,694 --> 00:01:08,630
increase in their numbers.

18
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,748
There seems to be nothing we can do about it.

19
00:01:13,928 --> 00:01:15,821
We now have a live report from Moscow.

20
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:16,988
Migel

21
00:01:21,588 --> 00:01:23,593
This is Red Square in Moscow.

22
00:01:24,018 --> 00:01:26,597
Behind me there are monkeys planting

23
00:01:26,597 --> 00:01:29,096
bananas all over the square

24
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:31,603
A total of 600 banana trees have been planted so far.

25
00:01:33,716 --> 00:01:35,677
Are you okay, Migel? Migel?

26
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,270
We move on now to a live report on from the front line

27
00:01:43,294 --> 00:01:46,211
protected by the Anti-Monkeys World Defense.

28
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,123
Uh, right now we are on

29
00:01:50,124 --> 00:01:52,123
the battlefield at the Port of Yokohama.

30
00:01:52,124 --> 00:01:54,038
This area has been contested by the monkeys,

31
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:56,126
and a fierce gunfight has broken out.

32
00:01:56,627 --> 00:01:58,792
Captain, captain, how is the battle going?

33
00:01:58,792 --> 00:02:00,467
Well, even though they're just monkeys, they've been hard to deal with

34
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:02,132
We've been constantly pushing only to retreat later.

35
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:04,638
Hurry! Take cover!

36
00:02:06,797 --> 00:02:08,141
It's dangerous! Get down! Get Down!

37
00:02:11,645 --> 00:02:13,145
Is this...a banana?

38
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,150
Idiot! Throw it away! Throw it away now!

39
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,311
That's a banana grenade!

40
00:02:19,147 --> 00:02:22,156
…they're just monkeys, but so hard to deal with…

41
00:02:22,156 --> 00:02:24,993
Captain! Are you okay?! Stay with me!

42
00:02:25,017 --> 00:02:26,259
Are you okay captain?!

43
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,981
Nonaka-san? Nonaka-san?

44
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:34,857
It appears to be a critical situation at the battlefront.

45
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,009
This just in.

46
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,548
The Anti-Monkeys World Defense has commented

47
00:02:44,024 --> 00:02:47,958
that they are engaged in a severe contact situation with the

48
00:02:47,982 --> 00:02:52,599
monkey's battleships over the cities of Los Angeles, Berlin,

49
00:02:52,623 --> 00:02:53,865
and Paris.

50
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,097
The image you're seeing right now is from Los Angeles.

51
00:02:59,057 --> 00:03:01,057
A local who witnessed the battle says that

52
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:05,243
the attack by the humans seemed to have no effect on the monkeys.

53
00:03:07,057 --> 00:03:11,108
From what I see, there's no way with all the banana, banana, banana.

54
00:03:11,988 --> 00:03:14,601
Definitely, the monkeys will win the battle.

55
00:03:16,055 --> 00:03:17,414
Back to Japan.

56
00:03:18,468 --> 00:03:21,654
Around the same time that the base at the industrial complex

57
00:03:21,678 --> 00:03:25,096
was destroyed, a huge new battleship appeared

58
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,707
above the nearby stadium.

59
00:03:27,694 --> 00:03:30,981
This battleship is believed to be the one of which the monkeys'

60
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:33,981
leader Specter was when he first arrived.

61
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:39,248
Some specialists say that the battleship is providing resources

62
00:03:39,272 --> 00:03:42,533
to the monkeys in order to construct another base.

63
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:47,706
As this battleship has not been seen since the initial attack,

64
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,798
it's reappearance is causing tension to mount in Japan.

65
00:03:53,172 --> 00:03:54,846
I am Fraya DeVapes,

66
00:03:54,873 --> 00:03:57,005
that was the latest news.
