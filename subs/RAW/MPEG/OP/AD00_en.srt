1
00:00:20,997 --> 00:00:23,324
Monkeys, go back to where you came from!

2
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:27,034
You should not have come here!

3
00:00:27,537 --> 00:00:29,027
Right now, our helicopter is flying over a

4
00:00:29,037 --> 00:00:32,436
massive battleship that has suddenly appeared in the sky.

5
00:00:32,446 --> 00:00:35,005
We might’ve walked into a trap.

6
00:00:35,015 --> 00:00:38,552
Professor, they're network security programs.

7
00:00:39,054 --> 00:00:41,038
They've been infected by a virus.

8
00:00:41,048 --> 00:00:41,652


9
00:00:41,682 --> 00:00:43,057
Let's go!

10
00:00:44,222 --> 00:00:46,557
I beg you! Please protect the Pipotrons!

11
00:00:47,188 --> 00:00:48,061
Haruka!

12
00:00:49,562 --> 00:00:52,118
This may be extremely dangerous

13
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:54,248
Aren't we in big trouble!?

14
00:00:54,258 --> 00:00:55,996
You finally showed up?

15
00:00:56,096 --> 00:00:58,418
Why do you look embarrassed?

16
00:00:58,428 --> 00:00:59,255
Wha?

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,164
M-Me?

18
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:03,657
It’s dangerous here! Enemies are closing in,

19
00:01:03,669 --> 00:01:05,349
we're being surrounded!

20
00:01:07,581 --> 00:01:09,943
Damnit, don't you dare interfere!

21
00:01:10,418 --> 00:01:11,282
Specter!
