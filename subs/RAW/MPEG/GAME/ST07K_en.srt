1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,527
Huh? This is weird. Where are we?

2
00:00:04,983 --> 00:00:08,042
Weren't we inside the battleship?

3
00:00:08,515 --> 00:00:11,505
Mm, this is a Virtual Space

4
00:00:11,515 --> 00:00:14,518
We might’ve walked into a trap.

5
00:00:14,858 --> 00:00:15,708
Ehh!?

6
00:00:15,996 --> 00:00:19,516
We need to find a way out fast. If we don’t, we’re in serious trouble.

7
00:00:19,527 --> 00:00:22,499
This place is completely under his control.

8
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:38,608
Huh!? It's Charu!

9
00:00:40,014 --> 00:00:43,544
Professor, they're network security programs.

10
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:45,879
They've been infected by a virus.

11
00:00:45,889 --> 00:00:50,020
Charu, when was the last time you connected to the network?

12
00:00:50,094 --> 00:00:51,154
I'm fine.

13
00:00:52,355 --> 00:00:56,940
Maybe... I’m the only one not infected by the virus.

14
00:01:33,934 --> 00:01:37,370
I can multiply as much as I want...

15
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:40,104
each one of them is the real me
