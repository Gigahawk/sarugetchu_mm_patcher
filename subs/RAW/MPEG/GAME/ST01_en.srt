This is NSB Emergency News

2
00:00:11,802 --> 00:00:15,982
Since TV stations in many countries have been attacked by monkeys,

3
00:00:16,006 --> 00:00:18,919
and broadcasting is now impossible from those countries,

4
00:00:18,943 --> 00:00:23,557
we're sending you multilingual updates from still available TV stations.

5
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,193
Here is the most recent news.

6
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:31,932
Enormous air battleships are being spotted all over the world

7
00:00:31,956 --> 00:00:33,956
as the attack of the monkeys continues.

8
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,738
Not only do they continue to take over the capitals of the world,

9
00:00:37,762 --> 00:00:41,075
but they are also appearing at famous banana farms.

10
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:45,679
So far, they have stolen more than 300,000 tons of bananas

11
00:00:45,703 --> 00:00:48,082
and carried them away with the battleships.

12
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:53,450
Analysts assume that these stolen bananas

13
00:00:53,474 --> 00:00:55,322
are provided to monkeys in the front line,

14
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:59,926
that they're high in nutrition, and very much loved by the monkeys.

15
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:03,898
There have also been many incidents reported

16
00:01:03,922 --> 00:01:05,922
of banana peels discarded by the battleships,

17
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:10,404
causing multiple residents to slip and fall.

18
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:17,243
The police are asking you to watch your step when you walk on streets.

19
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:20,914
We continue with the next news.

20
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:24,851
43 nations and the local communities have now

21
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:26,875
organized the Anti-Monkeys World Defense.

22
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,486
Until now it has been difficult to formulate a

23
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,129
counterattack due to a lack of global communications.

24
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,033
A spokesman for the defense has said

25
00:01:40,057 --> 00:01:45,639
effective attacks are going to be possible with these united forces.

26
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:53,347
Next up,

27
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:56,850
there has been a report that at one of the local areas,

28
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,320
the monkeys have successfully been forced out.

29
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:05,525
It is as yet unknown if it was an attack

30
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,394
by the Anti-Monkeys World Defense,

31
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,663
or the result of a local effort,

32
00:02:09,687 --> 00:02:12,098
but the damaged trailer that was driven

33
00:02:12,122 --> 00:02:14,122
by the monkeys was left at the site,

34
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:18,572
and a laser beam cannon has been found as well.

35
00:02:19,582 --> 00:02:21,651
Stop, you can't film here.

36
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:27,181
Specialists are saying that the system of this laser beam cannon

37
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:29,950
cannot be clarified by our current science,

38
00:02:29,974 --> 00:02:33,621
and they believe it is a weapon with substantial power.

39
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:37,124
There are reports saying that monkeys are building a base

40
00:02:37,148 --> 00:02:39,927
which may deploy the same kind of laser beam cannon

41
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,963
near an industrial complex by the coast.

42
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:48,901
Military specialists say that to lose this site to the monkeys

43
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,371
would be critical in a struggle to defend earth.

44
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,274
This is not simply monkeying around,

45
00:02:54,298 --> 00:02:56,943
it is an intelligently coordinated offensive

46
00:02:56,967 --> 00:03:00,413
which is causing grave concern to local residents.

47
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:02,916
I am Fraya DeVapes,

48
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,185
that was the latest news.
