1
00:00:04,985 --> 00:00:07,720
W-what!? They've escaped?

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,039
You...!

3
00:00:10,551 --> 00:00:13,540
You're useless!

4
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:26,570


5
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:43,310
Damn! You guys, let's get out of here!

6
00:00:45,118 --> 00:00:46,613


7
00:00:47,925 --> 00:00:52,016
Damn it... My plan has been ruined!

8
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:55,690
This ship is going to explode.

9
00:00:55,693 --> 00:00:58,160
I need to buy some time.

10
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,188
I’ll spread this—

11
00:01:01,466 --> 00:01:03,130
Hm? What's wrong?

12
00:01:06,135 --> 00:01:06,931
You!

13
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:08,641
What do you think you’re doing!?

14
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,171


15
00:01:27,591 --> 00:01:29,650


16
00:01:37,207 --> 00:03:00,578


17
00:02:17,309 --> 00:02:18,559
Good evening

18
00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:20,838
This is NSB Emergency News

19
00:02:21,578 --> 00:02:22,449
Breaking news

20
00:02:22,918 --> 00:02:24,346
We have been able to obtain

21
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,809
the following document

22
00:02:26,823 --> 00:02:27,845
Under The Monkey

23
00:02:28,254 --> 00:02:29,213
With The Monkey

24
00:02:29,905 --> 00:02:31,256
Flyers like these

25
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,984
are being distributed all over the world

26
00:02:35,846 --> 00:02:37,589
The Anti-Monkeys World Defense

27
00:02:37,613 --> 00:02:39,513
has released the following comment

28
00:02:39,537 --> 00:02:41,526
to the entire human race

29
00:02:43,465 --> 00:02:44,274
Citizens!

30
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:47,231
Please do not get deceived by these monkeys

31
00:02:47,638 --> 00:02:50,167
The monkeys plan to destroy the Earth,

32
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:52,136
enslave the human race,

33
00:02:52,638 --> 00:02:53,571
and conquer us!

34
00:02:54,137 --> 00:02:56,240
Do not get deceived!

35
00:02:58,014 --> 00:03:01,196
Local residents are forming their own civilian forces

36
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,780
aside from the Anti-Monkeys World Defense

37
00:03:04,522 --> 00:03:06,521
Here is a report on one of the groups

38
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:17,479
These villagers are training to capture monkeys

39
00:03:17,503 --> 00:03:18,750
using homemade nets

40
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:24,536
We're not worried about the monkeys,

41
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,923
we need to teach them a lesson

42
00:03:30,592 --> 00:03:33,983
Meanwhile, these men are making a monkey trap

43
00:03:34,636 --> 00:03:36,378
This is my invention.

44
00:03:36,402 --> 00:03:38,526
It is a trap for catching monkeys.

45
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,171
After placing the banana here...

46
00:03:46,905 --> 00:03:48,389
We wish the best for them

47
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,012
Next, on the news

48
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:55,199
One of the huge battleships in Japan has crashed into the sea

49
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:57,519
Details are not yet known

50
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,005
At the scene, we have Misato Nonaka

51
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:05,983
The battleship seems to have crashed into the sea up ahead.

52
00:04:06,217 --> 00:04:07,415
We have someone who witnessed the crash

53
00:04:07,425 --> 00:04:08,986
What was the situation like?

54
00:04:09,325 --> 00:04:11,322
Rather than attacking,

55
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:15,325
it looks like it self-destructed and crashed.

56
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,134
That’s how it seemed to me.

57
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,617
This footage of the battleship was taken by an eye witness

58
00:04:23,174 --> 00:04:25,905
As the ship explodes and crashes into the sea,

59
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:29,752
a green, mist-like smoke can be seen coming from it

60
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:33,515
Since the battleship fell,

61
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,196
there has been a completely new lifeform

62
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:37,612
vandalizing the cities

63
00:04:38,221 --> 00:04:40,899
These creatures have never been seen on the Earth before,

64
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:44,414
and very little is known about these creatures at present

65
00:04:45,543 --> 00:04:47,737
We warn you not to go out,

66
00:04:48,142 --> 00:04:50,988
and to exercise extreme caution

67
00:04:52,618 --> 00:04:54,202
I am Fraya DeVapes,

68
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,493
that was the latest news
