1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,011
Can you hear me?

2
00:00:01,509 --> 00:00:06,012
Hm? You’re that girl from the industrial complex...

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,040
The monkey's trailer is heading your way,

4
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:12,910
but it's being attacked...

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,156
Please, protect that trailer!

6
00:00:17,224 --> 00:00:19,049
What's up all of a sudden!?

7
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:22,963
Also, how dare you order me around like that!

8
00:00:24,435 --> 00:00:27,024
Are any of my subordinates in that trailer?

9
00:00:27,034 --> 00:00:31,493
Um... I think you’ve met them before...

10
00:00:32,556 --> 00:00:33,813
They're the Pipotrons

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,076
What!? The Pipotrons!?

12
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:46,109
Why would I rescue those weird monkeys

13
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:48,291
from who knows where!?

14
00:00:48,562 --> 00:00:49,119
Listen to me!

15
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:50,487
Y-Yes...

16
00:00:50,862 --> 00:00:53,184
No matter how many Blobs you defeat,

17
00:00:53,193 --> 00:00:56,399
they'll just keep regenerating!

18
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,985
In order to defeat the Blobs,

19
00:00:57,995 --> 00:01:01,975
you'll need to use a special weapon developed by that man

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,928
The trailer being driven by the Pipotrons

21
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,579
is carrying those weapons

22
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:09,610
I beg you! Please protect the Pipotrons!
