1
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,890
What is that?

2
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,560
Wow! It looks just like the town that was in virtual space!

3
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,620
Professor, when will this town be finished?

4
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,120
Yes, everything except the residential area

5
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,060
will be finished soon.

6
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,040
They are testing the network right now,

7
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,770
if there are no problems, it'll be ready to go.

8
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,110
Charu was implemented in part of the network, right?

9
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,320
Where? Where is she?

10
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,420
Wow! Charu is everywhere!

11
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,390
How many are there? Which one is the real Charu?

12
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,430
I can multiply as much as I want, each one of them is the real me

13
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,240
You might say that I'm the entire town.

14
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,630
Monkeys, go back to where you came from!

15
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,530
You should not have come here!

16
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,650
Right now, our helicopter is flying over a

17
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,160
massive battleship that has suddenly appeared in the sky.

18
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,660
There seems to be someone on what looks like the deck of the battleship.

19
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,200
It's a…monkey，it's an actual monkey!

20
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,400
There's a monkey on top of the battleship!

21
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,470
Monkeys and other creatures standing there.

22
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,710
There are no signs of humans at all.

23
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:23,710
Is this battleship crewed entirely by monkeys?

24
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,720
Many monkeys have already started

25
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,250
attacking the city.

26
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,950
Th-That's...?
